This is just a list of goals that would make me very happy (in no particular order):
- Star on the Github repo from Peppy
- Tournament players using the website
- Streamers using the website
- Tournament stream channels directing users to the website to get tournament info
- Any big number of stars

Why? This would give me a lot of motivation, that's it
